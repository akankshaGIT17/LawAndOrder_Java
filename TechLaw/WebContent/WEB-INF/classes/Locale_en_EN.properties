ourobjective=Our Objective

ourobjective1=The First Police Commission, appointed on 17 August 1865, contained detailed guidelines for the desired system of police in India and defined the police as a governmental department to maintain order, enforce the law, and to prevent and detect crime. The Indian Police Service is not a force itself but a service providing leaders and commanders to staff the state police and all-India Para-Military Forces. Its members, who are all at least university graduates, are the senior officers of the police. With the passage of time Indian Police Service's objectives were updated and redefined, the current rules and functions of an Indian Police Service Officer are as follows:

ourobjective2=To fulfil duties based on border responsibilities, in the areas of maintenance of public peace and order, crime prevention, investigation, and detection, collection of intelligence, VIP security, counter-terrorism, border policing, railway policing, tackling smuggling, drug trafficking, economic offences, corruption in public life, disaster management, enforcement of socio-economic legislation, bio-diversity and protection of environmental laws etc.

ourobjective3=Leading and commanding the Indian Intelligence Agencies like Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), Intelligence Bureau (IB), Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI), Criminal Investigation Department (CID) etc., Indian Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, Civil and Armed Police Forces in all the states and union territories.

ourobjective4=To interact and coordinate closely with the members of other All India Services and with the elite Indian Revenue Service and also with the Indian Armed Forces primarily with the Indian Army.

ourobjective5=Serve at head of the departments in policy making in the Ministries and Departments of Central and State Governments and public sector undertakings both at centre and states, Government of India.

ourobjective6=Last but not the least, to lead and command the force with courage, uprightness, dedication and a strong sense of service to the people.

ourhistory=History of Indian Police

ourhistory1=Prior to Independence, senior police officers belonging to the Imperial Police (IP) were appointed by the Secretary of State on the basis of a competitive examination. The first open civil service examination for admission to the service was held in England in June 1893 and the ten top candidates were appointed as probationers in the Indian (Imperial) Police. It is not possible to pinpoint an exact date on which the Indian Police came formally into being. Around 1907, the Secretary of State's officers were directed to wear the letters "IP" on their epaulettes in order to distinguish them from the other officers not recruited by the Secretary of State through examination. In this sense, 1907 could be regarded as the starting point.[1] In 1948, a year after India gained independence; the Imperial Police was replaced by IPS.

tipsforcitizens=Safety Tips

homealone= When Alone At Home

homealone1=These guidelines are basically for ladies or children who may be at home and alone.

homealone2=Beware of electricians, plumbers, carpenters, telephone mechanic. home delivery boy or a group of Sadhus. Unless you have called for them, you should not let them in your  houses without proper verification. In case such a person has been called, then you are advised to keep the main door open until he goes out.

homealone3=It would be better to have your house doors and windows properly secured by fixing iron grills and safety chains and key-holes.

homealone4=Never open your safe/almirah in front of your servant or even small children.

homealone5=Before engaging any domestic help, his/her character and antecedents should be got verified through a local police station and other sources.

homealone6=It is always desirable to engage a night watchman (Chowkidar) for your street/mohalla. Somebody from amongst you should also occasionally check him at odd hours to see if he is doing his duty properly.

homealone7=While keeping a new tenant, information should be given about him to the nearest Police Station so that his character and antecedents could be verified. Even if a new person has moved in your locality. his activities should also be watched closely and if need be, informed to the police.

roadsafety=Road Safety

roadsafety1=Keep all the relevant documents like registration, insurance, driving license and pollution certificate.

roadsafety2=One should not drink and drive.

roadsafety3=One should always keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.

roadsafety4=Do not jump the red lights for you can meet with an accident.

roadsafety5=Never drive with your head lights on in urban areas.

roadsafety6=The yellow line by the side of the kerb means "No Parking".

roadsafety7=The yellow line in the middle of the road means i.e. divider - so please do not cross this line, even while overtaking.

roadsafety8=The zebra lines are meant for pedestrian to cross the roads. Do not park/stop your vehicles on them.

roadsafety9=Never drive your vehicles with the elbow on the window of the driving door.

roadsafety10=One should observe lane discipline and avoid un-necessary over taking. Of late, Highway drivers have developed a wrong habit of giving the right indicators for some body following behind to over take. One should not pick up this wrong habit, because you are normally presumed to be turning right while giving your right indicator.

roadsafety11=Always give way to the vehicles coming from the right side - whether you are at an intersection or otherwise. The common belief is that the bigger vehicle has a right of way. But that is not correct. Only the vehicle coming from right side has a right of way. We must respect others' rights also.

roadsafety12=The number of people who lose their lives on the roads in India is apalling. We are ourselves to blame for it. All gentlemen do not mind wearing a crash helmet on their head, while riding the two wheelers, but do not consider it necessary that their better half, who is riding on the pillion, should also wear one. Remember the male to female sex ratio in the country is also decreasing so far as women are concerned. So both the riders on two wheelers must wear crash helmet.

train=Passengers safety in trains

train1=Beware of pick-pockets around the Booking-windows, stalls and on the platforms.

train2=Please check your ticket and cash before leaving the Booking -window.

train3=Always hire a registered coolie to carry your luggage and take a mental note of his number.

train4=Do not accept any gift/eatable from any stranger before/ during/ after your journey.

train5=Do not allow strangers to get in your bogey-immediately call the police. If possible, please lock your bogey from inside for your own safety.

train6=Please do not touch any unclaimed item/baggage lying on the platform or in the train. In case such a thing is found, immediately inform the Railway police.
